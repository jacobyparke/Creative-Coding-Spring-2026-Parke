Thoughts on “The Last Lecture”
In the “Last Lecture” I really enjoyed the analogy of the “brick wall” in the way of someone’s personal dreams and pursuits. 
The speaker compared roadblocks in the way of someone’s dreams as filtering out those that really want the dream truly. 
I liked all the separate goals he provided in his lecture, like being a Disney imagineer, being in zero gravity, along with others.
It was very remarkable to see the speaker's attitude when he received bad news about his health and that he didn't have much longer to live. 
I feel his speech could have been more effective if he cut some information out, but overall it was a good message.
