The primary differences between graphical user interfaces and command line interfaces are display and accessibility. 
Graphical interfaces are more visually driven and user-friendly. Examples include buttons, folders, cursors, and pop-ups. 
It’s the common conception of a “computer menu screen.” Command line interfaces use text and entering commands only to navigate your computer. 
Command line is more precise when the user knows what they are doing.  
For the general public, command line interfaces are more common.
