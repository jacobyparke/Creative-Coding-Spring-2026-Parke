Thoughts on “The Last Lecture”
In the “Last Lecture,” I really enjoyed the analogy of the “brick wall” in the way of someone’s personal dreams and pursuits. The speaker compared roadblocks in the way of someone’s dreams to filtering out those who truly want the dream. I liked all the separate goals he provided in his lecture, such as being a Disney Imagineer and experiencing zero gravity, among others. It was very remarkable to see the speaker's attitude when he received bad news about his health and that he didn't have much longer to live. I feel his speech could have been more effective if he had cut some of the information out, but overall, it was a good message. 


Learning Styles
I have conflicting thoughts about learning styles. Based on the learning style assessment test we took, I didn't necessarily agree with my results, which were 45% auditory, 35% visual, and 20% tactile. This is in reverse order. I think overall I learn best by hands-on work and being shown what to do, and auditory is my least compatible. I believe it depends on what the person is learning for the style to be applied. I don’t think there is a universal learning type for everything. It also depends on who is teaching; some teachers can reach those they are teaching better than others. In terms of fixed and growth mindsets, I think I am really stuck in a fixed mindset. I have been open to learning new things in the past, like math for example, and my brain just can’t grasp certain things.
